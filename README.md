# Programmer's Shift Keys

Programmer's Shift Keys takes your Shift keys, which are useless when pressed by
themselves, and makes them great by turning individual strokes into: `()`, `[]`, or
`{}`!

The original idea for this came from an
[article](http://stevelosh.com/blog/2012/10/a-modern-space-cadet/) by Steve Losh
where he remapped his shift keys to `()`. I've expanded on this idea by pairing
modifier keys with `Shift` to give `[]` and `{}`.

This project aims to make this available for multiple operating systems and,
ideally, will someday come with some way to install and configure Programmer's
Shift Keys. Until then, read the instructions in this file for your particular
situation.
